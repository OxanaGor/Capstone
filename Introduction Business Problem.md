## Introduction/Business Problem
  Our focus stays on the New York City - we have already began to explore and cluster the neighborhoods, so lets take a challenge of a real business problem exactly in this city. I keep also as background that we will use in our "investigation" the Foursquare location data. In order to make our project really meaningful, various and rich of data science tools that we have learned earlier and to show real "battle of neighborhoods" we need to choose a city (or borough) that:
1. have with redard to content different neighborhoods.
2. The Foursquare has the sufficient data about.
3. There are available/in our disposal another datasets that may help to provide our analysis.

  The New York City perfectly fulfill all this parameters and its the perfect case to for getting the most accurate and effective results in our data science project.

  As we know, the New York City has 5 boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island. 
My borough of interest is Brooklyn. It is the most populous borough. Brooklyn is known for its economical, cultural, social, and ethnic diversity and distinct neighborhoods. There are more than 60 neighborhoods in Brooklyn, so it will be interesting and challenging to cluster Brooklyn and compare the neighborhoods one with another in order to solve our business case.

  My Idea-case is considerably common and pretty often in real life: 
a unique business unit (company, shop, restaurant and so on) turns very successful and plans an expansion of territory. The scale of expansion always depends on the branch where the business unit runs, on the financial and human resources that are at disposal and competition on the marketplace.

 Let us assume there is a very successful home interior shop in Brooklyn, Neighborhood Greenpoint, called "Home of the brave".
The owner has an intention (and all the needed resources) to open 2 more shops in Brooklyn in different neighborhoods but he is not sure with new locations - that will be our task. 
But it will be not enough for the owner, just get 2 Neighborhoods' names in Brooklyn: he will know the Top 5 streets of each Neighborhood where it makes at most sense to rent a facility and open his new shops. 

 So the end product/ output of our data science project must be: 
1. The most appropriate 2 Neighborhoods in Brooklyn.
2. Top 5 streets in each appropriate Neighborhood, where it makes sense to locate the shop.

  The following tasks must be completed:
 1. To explore the Neighborhood Greenpoint where our first interior shop is situated.
 2. To define the features of a good location for an interior shop on the basis of the step 1. For example:
  - what nearby venues can attract the customers?
  - what is the "audience" (potential customers) live or work nearby?
  - how busy is the footage in the street where the existed shop is located?
  - what are the top venues in neighborhood and so on.
3. To find 2 neighborhoods that are the most similar to Greenpoint based on previous criteria.
4. To define and explore the potential customer's audience in these neighboorhoods and to find appropriate locations with the best footage in order to get Top 5 Streets.

  Without going into details at the moment we have our short path how to reach our target - help the owner of successful interior shop to find another the best possible locations for 2 new shops.
