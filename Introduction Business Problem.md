## Introduction/Business Problem
Our focus stays on the New York City - we have already began to exlore and cluster the neighborhoods, so lets take a challange of real business problem exactly in this city. I keep also as background that we will use in our "investigation" the Foursquare location data. In order to make our project really meaningful, various and rich of data science tools that we have learned earlier and to show real "battle of neigborhoods" we choose a city (or borough) that:
1. Contains impactly different neighborhoods.
2. The Foursquare has the sufficient data about.
3. There are available/in our disposal another datasets that may help to provide our analysis.
The New York City perfectly fullfil all this parameters and its the perfect case to for getting the most accurate and effective results in our data science project.

As we know, the New York City has 5 borough: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island. 
My borough of interest is Brooklyn. It is most populous borough. Brooklyn is known for its economical, cultural, social, and ethnic diversity and distinct neighborhoods. There are more than 60 neighborhoods in Brooklyn, so it will be interesting and challenging to cluster Brooklyn and compare the neighborhoods one with another in order to solve our business case.

My Idea-case is considerably common and pretty often in real life: 
A unique business unit (company, shop, restaurant and so on) turns very successful and have an expansion plan. The scale of expantion always depend on the branch where the business unit runs, on the financial and human resourses that are at disposal and competition on the marktplace.

Let us assume there is a very succesful home interior shop in Brooklyn, Neighborhood Greenpoint, called "Home of the brave".
The owner has an intention (and needed resourses) to open 2 more shops in Brooklyn in different neighborhoods but he is not sure with new locations - that will be our task. 
But it will be not enough for owner, just get 2 Neighborhoods' names in Brooklyn: he will know the Top 5 streets of each Neighborhood where it makes at most sense to rent a facility and open his new shops. 

So the end product/ output of our data science project must be: 
1. The most appropriate 2 Neighborhoods in Brooklyn.
2. Top 5 streets in each appropriate Neighborhood, where it makes sense to locate the shop.
